### Frontend Details

Key Features:
1. Login Page: Users can log in using their credentials.
2. Product Listing: Displays products in a grid format. Each product can be added to the cart.
3. Cart: Shows items added to the cart with total price and quantity.
4. Checkout: Allows users to place an order.
5. Order History: Displays a list of previous orders placed by the user.

Key Components:
1. LoginComponent: Handles user login and authentication.
2. ProductListComponent: Displays the list of available products and includes the "Add to Cart" functionality.
3. CartComponent: Displays the items in the cart and allows users to proceed to checkout.
4. AuthGuard: Protects routes that require authentication, such as the product list and cart.

### Backend Details
Key Features:
1. Product Management: APIs for retrieving product listings.
2. Order Management: APIs for placing orders, viewing order history, and managing carts.
3. Django Rest Framework (DRF): Used for building the RESTful APIs for the frontend to interact with.

Key Applications:
1. Products App: Manages the products available for purchase. It includes models for products and categories.
2. Orders App: Manages the user's cart, order placement, and order history.

## Setup Instructions

### Backend Setup (Django)

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. **Migrate the database**:
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```
3. **Run the development server**:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```
4. **API Endpoint**:
   ```bash
   /api-token-auth/: Login endpoint.
   /products-api/products/: Get all products.
   /orders-api/checkout/: Checkout and place an order.
   /orders-api/order-history/: Get previous orders.
   ```

### Frontend Setup (Angular)

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. **Run the development server**:
   ```bash
   ng serve
   ```
3. **Environment Configuration: Set the apiUrl in src/environment/environment.ts to point to your Django backend URL.**:
   ```bash
   export const environment = {
      production: false,
      apiUrl: 'http://127.0.0.1:8000'
    };
   ```

## Key Technical Notes
1. **Frontend**: Uses Angular Material for UI components. SCSS is used for styling.
2. **Backend**: Uses Django Rest Framework for API building. Models are linked using ForeignKey relationships.
3. **API Service**: The frontend communicates with the backend through a centralized API service in Angular (ApiService).
4. **Auth Guards**: Protects routes from unauthorized access.
